            <p>The Little Prince</p>
            <p> Antoine de Saint-Exupery , Translated by  Irene Testot-Ferry</p>
            <p>The Little Prince is a classic tale of equal appeal to children and adults. On one level it is the story of an airman's discovery, in the desert, of a small boy from another planet - the Little Prince of the title - and his stories of intergalactic travel, while on the other hand it is a thought-provoking allegory of the human condition.</p>
